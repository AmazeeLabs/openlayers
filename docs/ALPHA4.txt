Current for 6.x-2.0-alpha4

Between the OpenLayers 2.0-alpha3 and 2.0-alpha4 releases, there were 
several changes which clarified the module but are not backwards-
compatible with alpha3.

# OpenLayers Hooks

[Ticket](http://drupal.org/node/723530#comment-2688276)

Upgrading:

* Update hook definitions to implement `openlayers_openlayers_layers`
  instead of `openlayers_openlayers_layers_info`
* Update hook definitions to implement `openlayers_openlayers_styles`
  instead of `openlayers_openlayers_styles_info`
